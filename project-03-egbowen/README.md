## Reflection
Final: 5/22/23
Do you think it is complete?
- I do think this is complete. The birds are the most complex part of this. Though a fairly general process to impliment, this pushed my understanding of physical systems and how the different factors interact.
What part are you most proud of?
- making the birds work. I had a really difficult time with this, and I'm pretty happy with how this turned out.
What part are you least proud of?
- The water. I wanted to make it multiple lines of varies colors moving differently, but I ran into a problem and decidede that my efforts are better served working on the birds. 

What was the hardest part?
- the birds. Figuring out how to accumulate the forces and averages was ver confusing.

What, if anything, have you gained by completing this project?
A better understanding of noise, how forces accumulate, and a nice picture. I'm also in another class on Italian Landscapes, and it was interesting to think of maknig this in the context of "is this really il paesaggio?" Paesaggio means landscape in italian and has a more personal experienced based meaning.

what are you current happy with: I'm happy with how I;ve used the noise function and the fact that the birds actually flock
what are you not currently happy with: I'm not sure if it is becaseu my computer is old or if it actually slow, but sometimes the birds move not quite as smoothly as I'd like.
what questions do you have about it: Whan can I do to improve the runtime?
what are the biggest challenges going forward: figuring out when I am done. It is hard to know when I have done enough.
